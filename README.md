# Janus Express Server

## Janus project

A smart time and attendance management system that uses BLE beacons and a mobile phone.

If a detecting device enters a location that the beacons are placed at least three, the device reads how far each beacon is and calculates where the device is in place.

The detecting device, a mobile phone generally, sends every entrance and exit log to the server and the server gathers all of the data and can provide them the useable information.

## Todos

## Successor of the old gradutaion project

This project is a successor of [my old graduation project](https://github.com/awesometic/207lab_iot_project).

It was working very well as our team expected and I thought that it'd be so interesting if I can work on this project again. But with my 5-years-later eyes, the old code is really spaghettied so I gave up maintaining the existing codes. It led me to start a new project. :sweat_smile:

I believe it can be a really good chance to study modern **Node.js** with **Express.js**, **SASS** and **Typescript (ES6+)**. :smile:

This project is made just **for fun**. Hope I would finish this big project again.
